# 6.23.17 v0.i

dear blog,

so it happened again today.. it's been a while.. so many times during the leaving of california.. but not so much recently.. starts with hands and arms going 'numb' / 'tingly {?}' ..until whole upper body.. then that 30 sec of complete emptiness in the upper body ..weird feelings / visions i can't place.. just as tho i'm not here.. it feels more like SoCal.. but not in a good way...
