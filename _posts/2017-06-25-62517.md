..same again.. I don't get it.. and now I'm feeling the skin on my whole body prickling up, it's a weird remmy back to a feeling which must have been shortly.. but i don't know whether it even actually existed or not.

my memory going backwards is severely limited at the moment, well in terms of did it actually happen ? ..feeling completely lost.. and not sure how to get out of this worm hole.. read a complete message on messenger that i have no recollection of at all, even tho it looks like it was a sober conversation.. and not that long ago.. i think the only ansa is to turn facebook back on.. maybe that's the reason i seem to be going slowly crazy.. lack of correspondence with anyone.. here goes nothing..
