sitting here thinking.. thinking how HGST gave me a great life in SoCal.. only to be trashed by WD.. i don't mind losing a job.. get another.. but in this case i had to leave friends, life, everything behind...

my entire 2 bed apartment went to goodwill .. i guess it had good use over 6 years.. but still.. glad the Tiffany glasses ended up with the local bar staff.. enjoy..

i built a life in SoCal.. now have nothing.. literally just 2 bags of clothes.. it would be easy to survive if i was still home.. jeez linkedin offers me jobs everyday .. but sitting here in the uk .... ?

i have less possessions than i did as a student.. in some ways a good thing.. two bags can travel.. but its the life i am missing ... it wasn't WD's fault .. Sandisks.. i miss my friends.. and life I had ... simple solutions out there.. but ffs...
