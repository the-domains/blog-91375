3 times today.. can't explain it .. but now seems like a 'pull' ..walking down the street.. body tenses.. feel hot.. feel something all over body.. strange feeling.. feels like i'm about to understand the images.. then lose them .. but all something related to SoCal..

i don't know why I called it a 'pull'.. just it's physical.. and not just psychological..
