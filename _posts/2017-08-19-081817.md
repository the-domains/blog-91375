  .. been chatting with H Xx.. watching Ralphie at daycare.. it’s all like
  throwback to a few years ago.. but too soon.. not feeling ready.. talking to H
  is great, distracts me from everything but it’s hard atm.. diff paths... I
  have nothing now.. no home, no possessions, no job, could even say no future
  atm.. so happy for H tho.. it's all seems to be going great for her.. which
  makes it difficult when the convo turns to ‘we should do this… ‘ .. ‘we should
  do that..’.. and with no real ansa to those.. end up trying to ignore / bypass
  the Q..
