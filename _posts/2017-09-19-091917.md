can't even be bothered by an image... panick attacks (?) and short of breath today... thought it was gonna be ok.. but the 'short of breath' .. just came back... 

I don't even know whether it was panick attacks.. am just guessing.. couldn't breathe.. felt dizzy.. hot.. and sweaty.. couldn't pick a glass bottle off the shelf for fear of dropping it... at the registrar.. felt so shaky.. luckily it was contactless payment.. so kinda easy to do... all felt better until just now .. am indoors .. about to go to bed .. so no reason... 

panick attack.. or anxiety ? .. playing with fingers as I type.. in a restless way ... gonna sleep.. but no i won't.. mind is now gonna go haywire.... again.... legs feel hollow ???
