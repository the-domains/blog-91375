was talking to G.. she's going thru much worse than me atm.. was goed to talk.. i lied when she asked if i was drunk.. but as it was 3am.. am guessing she knew... i have a plan in the back of my head .. but it's just getting it to the front to actually work.

working on grid sites is actually a help.. if not frustrating at times! ..if i want something now.. i'm getting really bad at waitin'... just give me v3!

like hitting a brick wall at times...
