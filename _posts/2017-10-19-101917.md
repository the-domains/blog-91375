my memory is going.. or I'm selectively blocking ?.. I don't know which is the ansa.. my parents reminded me that they came to the US 3 times for christmas.. I can remmy one time.. 

I went through instagram.. no help.. went through iPhotos and found a 2nd christmas tree.. a tree before the christmas I remmy .. so that makes 2.. there were photos of NYE at The Cannery.. I don't remmy it at all...

The only NYE I remmy is in San Diego... the 3rd christmas.. I have nothing on file to agree to.. but they are adament.. also adament that each year there was a tree.. so where's the photo of the 3rd tree... I'm beginning to believe them as I can't remmy anything about the other christmas.. so whats blocking my memory.. 

I remmy everything else in SoCal during those times.. I remmy every work day / situation.. getting annoying now.. the're all off to spain for this christmas.. I can't handle it.. need to get out of it...
