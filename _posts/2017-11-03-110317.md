  I thought that was all over.. but 5 times now in the last 2 days.. will be
  working on something.. will get a sudden flash of something, that isn’t
  memory.. but a vision I recognize.. then the strange feeling all over the body
  again.. skin tingles.. like being enveloped in something.. lasts for less than
  a minute.. but hasn’t happened for a while so not sure why back… i just wish
  it would go away…
