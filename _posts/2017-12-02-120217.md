  back over the last few days.. and s’rsly don’t watch tv talent shows.. the
  smallest thing makes me want to cry… and it doesn’t even have anything to do
  with me.. a close friend thinks I may have PTSD.. not been back in the country
  long enough to have a doctor.. or know who else to talk to.. I think I’d be
  better going back home for a bit.. hell nearby is a sanctuary city…
