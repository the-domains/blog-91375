  Last 3 days it’s back.. sudden vision and body starts to freeze.. it seems
  like a memory.. feels like a memory.. but it never actually happened. I know
  it never actually happened so don’t understand why the visions are so vivid
  and feel real.. I need to get away from here or do something quickly.. SoCal
  isn’t the ansa until I can find a way to live there again.. but somewhere
  needs to happen..
