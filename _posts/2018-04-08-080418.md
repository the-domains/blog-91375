The last 36 hours have been weird.. like a throwback to some of the earlier posts. 3 times so far I've basically froze.. I quick image in my head .. followed by the tingling feeling all over my body.. and the image is meant to mean something .. but it doesn't.. I don't get it..

I can't even remmy what the image was .. but some type of building 'brick' ... it never really happened .. so I don't get why I feel it did for like 30 - 60 sec...

Earlier tonite I kinda lost my memory.. in terms of didn't know what I was doing here, had no clue about employment etc.. totally forgetting I've actually signed a consultancy agreement with a company, that I'm just waiting to start..

I know H is going to ask how my weekend was, and really wish I could tell her this crap.. but she'll just think I'm crazy..! ..I mean maybe I am .. but haven't had these feeling for a month or two.. and crap lets admit it .. I never had them before I lost my job in the States.. WD.. it's all your fault...
